title:  "The Specsheet"
---

I saw a youtube thumbnail for a "tech youtube" channel doing the latest iPhone review. Just for fun, I watched about 3-4 of these reviews from different creators.

Here's what I observed:
- All of them were basically quoting the specsheet.
- They did some tests, like filming a video, and then gave their opinion on how good it looked.
- They listed pros and cons, but their reasons for why a con was a con wasn't well argued. (It was more like a complaint without concrete reason)

So what I thought was:
- If you are complaining about something (in this case, the phone's photo quality was subpar), then either you fix it yourself or stop complaining about it.
- You don't know how hard it is to do something. Complaining is easy.
- Does the specsheet even matter? Do your eyes know what the difference between AMOLED and OLED? Is 8K *that* different than 4K?

So that led me to think, how should you decide whether to buy a materialistic desire?

I think the answer is quite simple.
- Product does what you want.
- Product has good build quality.
- Product will last for a long time.

The last two statements are kind of proportional to each other. 

So in the end, the specsheet doesn't matter. It's just a bunch of numbers, and for every iteration of the product, unless there's a signifcant hardware change, those numbers are just numbers.
