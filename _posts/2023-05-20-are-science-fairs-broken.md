title:  "Science fairs are broken"
---

It was the night of the awards banquet. I had won bronze. However, I was in absolute shock. I was confident I deserved higher (yes, I know it sounds selfish. Keep reading for the reasoning).

So, instead of complaining, I decided to anaylze the situation and deduce *why* I got a bronze. It wasn't because my project sucked. It was simply because no one in science fairs knew what was going on.

As the ceremony progressed, I noted down what every person in my category won. Interestingly, people who I had expected to get a gold and nothing less, got a bronze and people who shoudn't have won anything got a silver or higher.

That led to my first hypothesus: the "judges" don't value originality and dislike actual research. For example, one of the people who won gold had simply *replicated* a paper. Think about that. Another, who had won silver, had followed a YouTube tutorial to create an "AI" for a task. Any somewhat experienced developer would know that there were hundreds, if not thousands of tutorials for that subject. On the contrary, one person who had actually developed something novel and credible enough to be commodified, had been denied a silver and gold. I wasn't able to make sense. I was trying to identify patterns, except it seemed the judging was arbitary and meaningless.

What was much more fascinating was the story of this person:

She had a streak of winning gold. Every year participated, she won a gold. Hmm. Perhaps, I had found a true genius that was able to not only have novel ideas, but execute it to reality flawlessly. After I aligned the projects each year in my browser, I found out that each successive one was merely the previous one with a tiny thing added on top. The tiny thing wasn't even novel. It was basics that any reasonable person conducting an experiment would perform. To add to the misery, the initial project itself was well researched already. I was no expert, let alone an amateur at the field, but a simple google search showed lots of papers and projects very similar to her's.

Unironically, this situation was generalizable to prestigious fairs - such as ISEF. One person told me someone he knew didn't win anything at ISEF, but then worked under a professor who really liked his research.

That's the thing, then. I realized if you want to do and share original research, you are 10x better off finding a professor to assist. Silly fairs like this are useless and if nothing else, provide a false sense of academic validity. Not to mention, how you are a "scientist" now.

Adding onto the whole science fair scandal, if the winners were truly "researchers", how come none of them have ever published a paper in a well-established academic journal (not those student ones that are unworthy). Moreover, and this is a very, very personal take: 

*If you were so good and science fairs were valued in the real world, wouldn't you be sought after by well-respected companies for your innate talent?*

It's a fun world we live in, isn't it?
