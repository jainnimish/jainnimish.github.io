title:  "Science fairs are broken"
---

Science Fair 2023. It was the night of the awards banquet. I knew my project had merit and was confident of winning at least a silver. Much to my dismay, this was not the case. I won bronze instead.

So, instead of complaining, I decided to analyze the situation and deduce *why* I got a bronze. In short, it wasn't because my project sucked. It was simply because no one in science fairs knew what was going on.

Here’s what I did. As the ceremony progressed, I noted down any winners who were from my category or related categories - Curiosity and Ingenuity and Digital Technology. Much to my surprise, people who I had expected to get a gold and nothing less, got a bronze and people who shouldn’t have won anything got a silver or higher. My judgements of who should win what was a culmination of the journey the person took to develop the project, novelty, and weather it was useful - at a reasonably large scale. 

Let’s talk about the actual results now.

- One of the people who won gold had simply *replicated* a paper.
- Another person who had won silver, simply followed a YouTube tutorial to create an "AI" for voice recognition. Any somewhat experienced developer would know that there were hundreds, if not thousands of tutorials for that subject.
- One person who had actually developed something novel and credible enough to be commodified, had been given bronze.

I wasn't able to make sense. I was trying to identify patterns, except it seemed the judging was arbitrary and meaningless. It seems the judges dislike original research. Unfortunately, the rabbit hole goes further down.

After I got home, I browsed the science fair’s portal that showed all the projects in a digital, poster-like format. After I finished with one year, I went to the previous year’s projects, and so on. A particular project stuck out to me the most. We’ll call this person X.

X had a streak of winning gold. Every year X participated, X won gold. Maybe I had found the ideal person that was able to not only have novel ideas, but execute it to reality flawlessly. I looked at every project X made for each consecutive year. I found that each successive project was merely the previous one with a tiny thing added on top. The tiny thing wasn't even novel. It was basics that any reasonable person conducting an experiment would perform. To add to the misery, the initial project itself was well researched already. I was no expert, let alone an amateur at the field, but a simple google search showed lots of papers and projects very similar to X’s.

Unironically, this situation was generalizable to seemingly prestigious fairs - such as ISEF. Silly fairs like this are useless. If nothing else, they provide a false sense of academic validity. If the winners were truly "researchers", how come none of them have ever published a paper in a well-established academic journal (not those student ones that are worthless). My final remark is:

*If you were so good and science fairs were valued in the real world, wouldn't you be sought after by well-respected companies for your innate talent?*

Finally, after talking to some folks on Discord communities about this, I found out that you can do quality research with a professor instead. One person told me someone he knew didn't win anything at ISEF, but then worked under a professor who really liked his research.
