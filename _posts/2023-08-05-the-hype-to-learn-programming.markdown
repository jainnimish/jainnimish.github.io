title:  "The hype to learn programming"
---

Shortly after the release of ChatGPT and other LLM's, people were excited everywhere.

But the group of most excited people weren't machine learning engineers, but rather a bunch of highschoolers looking to use the model to *enhance* their education.

Soon, they begin looking at how the entire pipeline works: from text to tokenization to prediction and output rendering. Every kid I knew of wanted to build their own GPT.

Most, having never written a single line of code, went to the place to find answers: `Google.`

Now, don't get me wrong, the internet is amazing; tons of articles and material to read for free, websites and sources you can use to quench your thirst for knowledge and an ecosystem to interact with people.

But what exactly happens when you google `How to learn programming?` You get a vast array of sites all claiming to teach you how to program, all in X time. Most YouTube tutorials show their "cool" projects, and then give you an hour long tutorial on how to reproduce it. They make it look so easy and harmless to learn.

Then these gullible students, click those tutorials, print `hello world` in python and think alas, I'm cool too, and a genius. They show their friends, and the chain of exponentation starts, and soon you have a bunch of people claiming to ***know*** programming.

It's all a great story, right? Everyone's interested in programming, the youth are forming a pool of developers, and they're bringing their innovative ideas to life.

But no.

This is exactly the problem. With so many people endorsing programming, and schools, sites, all willing to teach you, there has to be a little caveat.

### The problem
First misconception. Learning a programming language is not the same as learning to program.

The art of programming doesn't involve learning new syntax; that's easy. What's hard is to debug - and no, debugging isn't going on stack overflow and finding the answer. It is to write clean, elegant and understandable code. This isn't taught anywhere though and while this *learn-language-be-programmer* illusion makes people *think* they're programmers, what they're really doing is diluting the pool of talented ones.

The second problem. Coolness.

Let's take the current hot topic: machine learning. At a lot of student-led or hackthons for students, there's a lot of projects involving machine learning. Some aiming to cure cancer by detecting it with a CNN, others making driving safer by using a Arduino with a prebuilt Tensorflow model to monitor blindspots. 

Now two things. First notice the word **prebuilt** there. A lot of people are using easily accessible models pretrained and then claiming to have used "machine learning." But what they've really done is use an API to query the model and use it's output. In my opinion, that's not machine learning. To me, it's almost plagiarism, taking someone else's work and copy-pasting it. While that person actually understood the low-level concepts to create something beautiful, this person simply *used* it without contributing anything to the work. Instantiating a machine learning model ***doesn't*** mean you know machine learning. And in the grand scheme of things, this leads to a bigger problem - when you show your work to people who don't know a thing about machine learning, they think "ah this is cool" and further encourage you to keep it up. This is a false infinite staircase, because you'll think what you are doing is truly amazing and keep flipping out these silly projects.

The second is usability. These one day or side projects are often used as a way to boost résumés. Most of these easy ideas have already been addressed in proper research, that is, this work is not applicable in the real world. 

Both these comments lead to the topic of passion. These days, most high school students are far too busy hyping up their résumé, they're willing to gamble on any trail that promises some results at the end. Something worthwhile.

But what they don't realize is after university admissions, these activities are worthless. So, the question is, why devote so much time doing something that you'll never remember anyway?
