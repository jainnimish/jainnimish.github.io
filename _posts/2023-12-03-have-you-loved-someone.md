title:  "Have you loved someone?"
---

I was watching Good Will Hunting and one line struck me:
> You don't know anything about real loss, because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself.

Somehow, this led to a flashback to The Wolf of Wall Street. More specifically, the moment where his wife left him because he was going to be arrested. That led to me questioning why you even "love" someone.

I've observed a couple of things when I look at other people:

I "love" you because ...
- Look good
- Money

Generic reasons:
- Nice, thoughtful, ...

To put it in Will-Hunting style, I think there's a certainty in life. You can tell me all about what it means to love someone. But, if I ask you one simple question: Why do you love that person? I'm willing to bet that your reasons will align perfectly with the aforementioned ones.

I think love is just a misnomer with layers of abstraction. So, have you dared to love anyone, then?
