title:  "Something to die for?"
---

What do you want to be when you grow up? Everyone's heard this question and thought of a fantasy job. In the end, though, most people just want money. 

I'll cut to the chase.

- Does what you do matter? Is there skill involved in the profession. Anything that has a 100% success rate after you receive training, isn't a skill-based profession. If anyone can do it and you are not special, then you're just wasting your time.
- This is easy to say but die to wake up next day and work. These folks don't know what the time is. Work is pleasure. I say this a lot to my friends, and oftentimes the reply back is "I don't know what I love." If that's your reply, then I'm afraid no one knows the answer. My question to you is are you willing to take a step in the perpetual machine of mundanity and do a mediocre job you don't care about for 60 years?
- Do you want to be the best at what you do? These dumb skills - kindness, compassion are never as fruitful as skill. The world is a place of ruthless, constant change. Not only do you have to want to be the best, but actually do stuff to reach there. Impact, not intent ;)

My main thought is if what you do could be done by a robot in the upcoming years, then do you really have something to live for?

### Activities.

I'm unsure as to why, but I love digressing about resumes. Especially as a high-schooler, where the length people go to just to save resumes is satirical. 

A list of "activities" that send me into oblivion:
- Why organize events that are useless?
    - For example, student-led hackathons these days is guided solely by sponsor prizes. "I see company X has a prize for integration with API Y, so I'll gladly use it." **WHY?** Folks are learning nothing except how to instantiate pretrained ML models and/or use API's to interact with microservices. The fundamental parts of programming, such as debugging and writing clean code are bid farewell.
    - Is this really what the goal of a hackathon is? To win prizes?
    - Hackthons aside, almost anything CS-related is BS. I have digressed about this [here]({% post_url 2023-08-05-the-hype-to-learn-programming %}).
- Starting a nonprofit for some obscure goal.
    - Is this idea even scalable or just for the duration of your highschool so you can put it on a resume.
    - If this issue is already being addressed on a global scale, then why are you doing it? I've seen countless "startups" with the goal of teach you X in Y time. Is this a joke? No really, is this a joke?
- Science fairs. No. [Please]({% post_url 2023-05-20-are-science-fairs-broken %}).
- Participating in most other clubs/organizations that are school-affiliated. Examples are DECA, HOSA, etc..
    - What have you gained? Is this going to make you a "successful" individual? Will you be able to produce a unicorn startup for me with your knowledge in every area of business?
    - Does it align with you goals and ultimately what you want to do in life?

It doesn't matter what you do. If you are the best at it, companies will want you to work for them. They'll come for you. Being awesome at 1 thing is infinity times better than doing 10 things in a mediocre state. Pawn of all trades, Master of none.

It's about picking one thing and when someone asks if you're good at this, you slap that thing in that person's face and say, what do you think?

Some examples of this:
- Olympiad medalists (IMO, IPhO, IOI).
- People who have created organizaitons that have unique ideologies and are building innovative solutions. Not just duplicating a well-known solution and taking advantage of being a student and bragging about it in that regard.
- Real research to advance some field. A publication in a credible professional journal to back it up.
- National/International level at some sport.
