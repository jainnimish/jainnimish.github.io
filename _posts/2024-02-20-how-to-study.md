title:  "Hitchhiker's Guide to Taking Notes and Passing Exams"
---

These suggestions are only for STEM classes.

Terrible grief is bestowed upon me when I observe how classmates take notes.
This post is mostly a brief elaboration on the phrase
> Study smarter, not *harder*

### The mistake
Folks are not taking *notes* - they are simply writing down what the teacher is saying/writing on the board **word for word**. The biggest issue with this approach is that it requires as much time spent in class to actually understand the notes. Humans can either write or talk or read, but simply cannot do both or all at the same time. When taking notes this way and blindly copying words, you fail to understand the topic. IMO, class time should be spend writing no notes and only paying attention. Paying attention unlocks a super-power: critical thinking. You question everything taught to you and during this exercise, you find things you don't understand. This is crucial. The point of note-taking is precisely to summarize your thoughts on topics you don't understand. If you were to take this class again and not understand the same concept, referring back to your notes should refresh your memory and speed up the process of rethinking and reunderstanding.

### What to take notes on?
This framework is what I've been abiding by. I can **pass** my exams while studying for a maximum of 45 minutes, so it works well.

You should take notes on:
- Things you didn't understand during class time. Take time to think and reason out what you didn't understand, and then summarize **how** you managed to understand it in your notes. It should be personalized for you; don't write notes to help other people understand.
- Nothing that is on a PowerPoint or the instructional material you have access to when studying for the exam.
- (Optional) Interesting things the teacher says in random digressions that aren't a part of the course. Often, I find these to be infinitely more valuable than course content.

### Study workflow
- After the class is over, and you're in a non-STEM class, do the homework from that STEM class. Non-STEM classes usually have little workloads so (ab)use the time. You should be done your homework within school time itself.
- Go home and write notes on the aforementioned topics.

Now, when the exam comes, you are already ready. Just need to do a barebones review of everything you've learned and refer back to the slides. You should already be done all homework questions but take this time to redo questions you had a hard time on. It is wrong to think that you can study for an exam in one day. Studying is an incremental process, and each day is only worth a little bit. Cumulatively, however, this framework yields maximum performance in the amount of days from when the unit first started to when the exam date is.


### What about non-STEM courses?
- Good luck cramming. 
- Refrain from using software like Anki. Anki's algorithm optimizes for long-term learning, which requires a couple of weeks at least.
- Know how well you cram and schedule your cramming time so you cover all the material.
