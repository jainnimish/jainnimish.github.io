title:  "Trap of stressing about university admissions"
---

- Don’t stress about getting into university early on.
  - The more you think about this the more you do things just to get in[^1] - which just leads to rejection.
  - The best “guide” to getting into university is simply proving to them you have a passion. Something that makes you wake up every morning.

[^1]: Most people I know do this. Say you partake in 5 EC's you are not passionate about. Then, after you get in, you drop those EC's because you are not interested. Well, now you've just wasted so much time over the past 4 years doing something that you didn't care about. You could've spent this time on what you actually like.
