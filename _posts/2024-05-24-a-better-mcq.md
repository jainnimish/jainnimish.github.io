title:  "A better MCQ format"
---

After having taken a number of standardized exams recently, I couldn't come to terms with the Multiple Choice section. This was because these questions didn't test understanding but rather the ability to decrypt twisted wording.

I propose a new form of multiple choice to fix this. This format is for physics/mathematics questions and not subjects that test memorization.

Here are characteristics of the format:
- 4 options.
- After each MCQ, there should be a line for the examinee to write a brief sentence to explain why chosen option is correct.

Example:
- **Question**: What are the roots of the polynomial `x^2 + 2x`?
- **Options**: A, B, C, D
- **Explain**: Derived answer by factoring `x` out.

Why this is better than regular MCQ:
- In case a silly mistake was made but reasoning was correct, part marks can be given.
- If a lot of people got the reasoning wrong, maybe the concept wasn't clear or the question wasn't well-framed.
- Makes guessing harder.
